      - Each roadmap phase has duration, target_maturity, investment_usd, deliverables
      - policy_library_ref, architecture_diagrams_ref, compliance_mapping_ref exist
      - Compliance mapping includes NIST 800-53 controls
    validation_criteria:
      - Roadmap phases align with maturity progression (Traditional → Initial → Advanced → Optimal)
      - Investment estimates are realistic ranges (not single numbers)
      - Compliance mapping references specific controls (e.g., AC-3, IA-2)
      - Token usage ≤ 12000 tokens
    pass_conditions:
      - Gap analysis shows clear current vs. target for all pillars
      - Roadmap is actionable with concrete deliverables per phase

    name: "Deployment Model Selection - Kubernetes-heavy Environment"
    description: "Select appropriate deployment model for cloud-native K8s environment"
    inputs:
      target_environment: "cloud"
      current_architecture: "80% workloads on Kubernetes (AWS EKS), microservices architecture"
      assessment_tier: "T2"
      ztmm_pillars: ["networks", "applications"]

      - components.micro_segmentation references service mesh (Istio/Linkerd/Consul)
      - Policy examples include service-to-service authorization
    validation_criteria:
      - Deployment model justification references Kubernetes and microservices
      - Service mesh recommendation is specific (not just "use a service mesh")
      - mTLS implementation guidance is provided
      - Token usage ≤ 6000 tokens
    pass_conditions:
      - Micro-segmentation approach is K8s-native (service mesh, network policies)
      - Recommendation aligns with cloud-native best practices

    name: "CISA ZTMM Maturity Progression - Partial Implementation"
    description: "Assess partially implemented zero-trust with uneven pillar maturity"
    inputs:
      target_environment: "hybrid"
      assessment_tier: "T1"
      ztmm_pillars: ["identity", "devices", "networks", "applications", "data"]
      current_architecture: "Identity: Advanced (FIDO2 MFA), Networks: Traditional (flat), Apps: Initial (OAuth2 for 20%)"
    expected_outputs:
      - maturity_assessment shows uneven scores (Identity=Advanced, Networks=Traditional, etc.)
      - critical_gaps prioritizes lowest-maturity pillars (networks, data)
      - quick_wins focus on bringing "Traditional" pillars to "Initial"
    validation_criteria:
      - Maturity scores reflect stated current state accurately
      - Critical gaps correctly identify "Traditional" and "Initial" pillars
      - Recommendations are sequenced (foundation → advanced)
      - Token usage ≤ 2000 tokens
    pass_conditions:
      - Assessment correctly differentiates pillar maturity levels
      - Recommendations prioritize gaps (not already-mature pillars)
