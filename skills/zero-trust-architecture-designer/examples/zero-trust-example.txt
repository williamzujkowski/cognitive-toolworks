Zero Trust Architecture Design - T2 Example

Input:
  target_environment: "hybrid"
  assessment_tier: "T2"
  ztmm_pillars: ["identity", "networks", "applications"]
  business_objectives: "Secure remote workforce, migrate to cloud"

1. CISA ZTMM Assessment:
   - Identity: Initial (Azure AD with MFA, no FIDO2)
   - Networks: Traditional (flat network)
   - Applications: Traditional (shared credentials)

2. Deployment Model: Hybrid (EIG + Micro-segmentation)
   Rationale: Cloud migration → EIG, datacenter → micro-seg

3. Components:
   - Policy Engine: Azure AD Conditional Access + ABAC
   - PEPs: Azure App Proxy, Istio Envoy
   - IdP: Azure AD with FIDO2 MFA
   - Micro-seg: Istio service mesh

Output:
{
  "deployment_model": "Hybrid",
  "components": {...},
  "roadmap_phase_1": "Deploy FIDO2, migrate 5 apps to OIDC"
}
