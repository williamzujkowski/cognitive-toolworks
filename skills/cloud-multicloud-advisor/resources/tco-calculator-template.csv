# NOTES:
# - All pricing as of 2025-10-25T21:30:36-04:00; verify current rates before use
# - Reserved instance pricing assumes 1yr or 3yr commitments (30-70% discount vs on-demand)
# - Egress costs are major TCO driver; optimize with CDN, regional caching, direct connect
# - Support tiers: AWS Business (3-10% monthly), Azure Standard (free), GCP Standard (free)
# - Hidden costs: certifications, multi-cloud tooling (Terraform, monitoring), training
# - TCO formula: (Compute + Storage + Network + Services + Support + Training/Tooling) × Time Horizon
