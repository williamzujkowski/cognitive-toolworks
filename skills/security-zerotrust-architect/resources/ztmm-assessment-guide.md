# CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model Assessment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides practical assessment criteria for evaluating zero-trust maturity across the five CISA ZTMM pillars.

## Five Pillars and Maturity Levels

### 1. Identity
- **Traditional**: Username/password authentication, no MFA, local accounts
- **Initial**: MFA deployed (SMS/TOTP), centralized IdP (Azure AD/Okta), SSO
- **Advanced**: Phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn), risk-based authentication, UBA
- **Optimal**: Continuous authentication, passwordless, biometric integration

### 2. Devices
- **Traditional**: No device inventory, no compliance checks, manual patching
- **Initial**: Device inventory (MDM), antivirus deployed, patch management
- **Advanced**: EDR/XDR deployed, automated compliance enforcement, device posture API
- **Optimal**: Real-time device posture assessment, automated remediation, zero-trust enrollment

### 3. Networks
- **Traditional**: Flat network, perimeter firewall only, unencrypted internal traffic
- **Initial**: VLANs/VPCs, basic segmentation, TLS for external traffic
- **Advanced**: Micro-segmentation, mTLS for service-to-service, encrypted DNS
- **Optimal**: SDP, application-layer segmentation, AI-driven traffic analysis

### 4. Applications and Workloads
- **Traditional**: Shared credentials, no app-level authN/authZ, static permissions
- **Initial**: App-level authentication, API keys, basic RBAC
- **Advanced**: OAuth2/OIDC, service mesh with mTLS, dynamic RBAC
- **Optimal**: Dynamic policy enforcement, RASP, runtime threat detection

### 5. Data
- **Traditional**: No data classification, unencrypted data at rest, no DLP
- **Initial**: Data classification scheme, encryption at rest, basic access logs
- **Advanced**: Encryption in transit and at rest, field-level encryption, DLP deployed
- **Optimal**: Continuous data monitoring, encrypted compute (confidential computing), homomorphic encryption

## Assessment Methodology

1. Review current capabilities for each pillar
2. Score against maturity definitions (Traditional â†’ Optimal)
3. Identify gaps between current and target maturity
4. Prioritize remediations (focus on "Traditional" pillars first)
5. Develop phased roadmap aligned with business objectives

## Cross-Cutting Capabilities (per CISA ZTMM v2.0)

1. **Visibility and Analytics**: Comprehensive logging, SIEM integration, UBA
2. **Automation and Orchestration**: Automated policy enforcement, SOAR integration
3. **Governance**: Policy management, compliance reporting, risk management
