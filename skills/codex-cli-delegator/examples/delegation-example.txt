DELEGATION DECISION TREE EXAMPLE
=================================

Scenario: "Create a Python CLI tool for managing todos"

Step 1: Task Analysis
  task_type: generation, existing_files: [], complexity: simple

Step 2: Scoring
  New file creation? YES → Codex +1
  Boilerplate/template? YES → Codex +2
  Total: Codex=3, Claude=0

Step 3: Decision (Codex ≥3, Claude ≤1)
  delegation_decision: codex
  execution_mode: non-interactive

Step 4: Command
  codex exec --prompt "Create Python CLI for todos with add, list, complete, delete using Click"

Step 5: Quality Checks
  [lint, test, security_scan, review]

Output: DELEGATE TO CODEX
