# Changelog - edge-computing-architect

All notable changes to the Edge Computing Architecture Designer skill will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this skill adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- Initial release of edge-computing-architect skill
- T1 tier: Fast platform recommendation and baseline architecture (≤2k tokens)
- T2 tier: Production-ready architecture with security, monitoring, state sync (≤6k tokens)
- Support for Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda@Edge, Azure Front Door/Functions
- IoT edge computing patterns for Azure IoT Edge and AWS IoT Greengrass
- CDN caching hierarchy design with multi-tier strategy
- State synchronization patterns (CRDTs, event sourcing, vector clocks)
- Multi-CDN strategy with failover and load balancing
- Security hardening (TLS 1.3, DDoS protection, WAF, rate limiting)
- Monitoring and observability patterns for edge deployments
- 6 authoritative sources with access dates (Cloudflare, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- Example deployment manifests and caching configurations
- 5 test scenarios in evals_edge-computing-architect.yaml

### Architecture Decisions
- Consolidated edge computing, CDN, edge functions, and IoT into single skill per analyst-implementation-plan.json
- Designed for composition with cloud-native-deployment-orchestrator dependency
- Platform-agnostic approach with specific guidance for major providers
- Progressive disclosure: T1 for quick wins, T2 for production deployment
