# Database Migration Plan Template

## Executive Summary
- **Migration Type**: [Platform/Version/Schema/Consolidation]
- **Source**: [Database type, version, size]
- **Target**: [Database type, version, platform]
- **Strategy**: [Big-bang/Blue-green/Continuous-replication/Trickle]
- **Timeline**: [Total duration]
- **Downtime**: [Expected downtime in minutes]

## Migration Strategy

### Approach Rationale
Why this strategy was chosen over alternatives.

### Tools and Technologies
- Schema migration: [Tool, version]
- Data migration: [Tool, version]
- Validation: [Tool, version]

## Timeline and Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1)
- Provision target infrastructure
- Setup monitoring and alerting
- Create baseline performance benchmarks
- **Duration**: X days

### Phase 2: Schema Migration (Week 2)
- Execute DDL scripts
- Create indexes and constraints
- Migrate stored procedures
- **Duration**: X days

### Phase 3: Data Migration (Week 3)
- Initial data load
- Incremental sync (if applicable)
- Verify replication lag
- **Duration**: X days

### Phase 4: Cutover (Day X)
- [ ] Stop application writes
- [ ] Verify data sync complete
- [ ] Update connection strings
- [ ] Resume application
- **Duration**: X minutes

### Phase 5: Validation (Week 4)
- Data reconciliation
- Performance testing
- Application smoke tests
- **Duration**: X days

## Rollback Procedure

### Rollback Triggers
Conditions requiring rollback:
1. Data integrity violations
2. Performance degradation >20%
3. Application errors >5% baseline

### Rollback Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
**Expected rollback time**: X minutes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Row counts match (100%)
- [ ] Query performance â‰¥ baseline
- [ ] Zero data loss
- [ ] Application tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off obtained

## Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Strategy] |

## Communication Plan
- Stakeholder notification: [Timeline]
- Status updates: [Frequency]
- Escalation contacts: [Names/roles]
