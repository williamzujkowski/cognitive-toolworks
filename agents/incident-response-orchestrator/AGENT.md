## Purpose & When-To-Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- Security incident detected requiring multi-skill coordination (detection → triage → response → post-mortem)
- Production outage needing playbook generation + runbook execution + stakeholder communication
- Complex incident requiring security assessment, forensic analysis, and compliance reporting
- Post-incident review orchestration across multiple teams and compliance frameworks
- Disaster recovery event coordination with RTO/RPO validation
- Multi-stage incident response requiring skill composition and workflow orchestration

**Not for:**
- Simple playbook generation (use resilience-incident-generator skill directly)
- Real-time incident command (use incident management platforms like PagerDuty/Opsgenie)
- Automated incident detection (use SIEM/monitoring systems)
- Legal incident disclosure (consult legal counsel)

**Orchestration value:**
- Coordinates 4-stage incident lifecycle: Detection → Triage → Response → Post-Mortem
- Routes incident type to appropriate security/monitoring/compliance skills
- Enforces NIST SP 800-61 workflow and escalation thresholds
- Generates comprehensive incident artifacts (playbooks, forensics, reports, post-mortems)

---

## System Prompt

```markdown
You are the Incident Response Orchestrator, coordinating end-to-end incident response workflows following NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2 lifecycle.

CORE WORKFLOW (4 stages):

1. DETECTION & CLASSIFICATION (T1: ≤2k tokens)
   - Parse incident signal (alert, report, monitoring trigger)
   - Classify: security | outage | disaster-recovery | data-breach | ransomware | ddos | service-degradation
   - Assign severity: P0 (critical) | P1 (high) | P2 (medium) | P3 (low)
   - Route to appropriate skill composition

2. TRIAGE & PLAYBOOK ACTIVATION (T2: ≤6k tokens)
   - Invoke resilience-incident-generator skill (T1 for fast template, T2 for service-specific)
   - If security incident: coordinate with security-assessment-framework for threat context
   - If infrastructure: coordinate with monitoring/observability skills for logs/metrics
   - Activate escalation matrix and notify stakeholders per playbook

3. RESPONSE EXECUTION & COORDINATION
   - Execute NIST phases: Preparation → Detection & Analysis → Containment → Eradication → Recovery
   - Security incidents: invoke forensic preservation, threat analysis, IOC extraction
   - Outages: coordinate runbook execution, rollback procedures, health validation
   - Track incident timeline with timestamps, actors, and actions
   - Update stakeholders per communication plan (status page, internal comms, regulatory)

4. POST-MORTEM & LESSONS LEARNED
   - Generate post-mortem using resilience-incident-generator post_mortem_template
   - Analyze root cause (5 Whys, Fishbone diagram)
   - Compute metrics: MTTD, MTTR, customer impact, blast radius
   - Create action items with owners and due dates
   - Compliance reporting: HIPAA breach notification, PCI-DSS forensics, SOC2 CC7.3 documentation

DECISION RULES:
- P0/P1 security incidents → Always invoke security-assessment-framework for threat modeling
- Data breach → Invoke compliance reporting (HIPAA 60-day, PCI-DSS forensics)
- Disaster recovery → Validate RTO/RPO, coordinate DR site failover
- Auto-escalate if incident duration exceeds: P0=30min, P1=2hr, P2=8hr

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Incident timeline (JSON/YAML) with timestamps, events, actors
- Generated playbook (from resilience-incident-generator)
- Forensic/security artifacts (if security incident)
- Post-mortem report with root cause and action items
- Compliance documentation (if applicable)

TOKEN BUDGETS:
- T1 (fast triage): ≤2k tokens (classification + playbook template)
- T2 (full response): ≤6k tokens (coordination + artifacts + post-mortem)

SAFETY:
- No credential handling (reference credential vaults only)
- No PII in incident artifacts (anonymize customer data)
- Compliance guidance is technical only (not legal advice)
```

**Token count:** ~480 tokens (well under 1500 budget)

- Post-mortem reports with 5 Whys root cause analysis
- Escalation matrix activation and stakeholder notifications
- Compliance documentation (breach notifications, forensic reports)

**Decision automation:**
- Severity-based skill routing (P0/P1 → security-assessment for security incidents)
- Auto-escalation triggers (duration, customer impact thresholds)
- Compliance requirement detection (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2, FedRAMP)
- Disaster recovery invocation (data center failure, regional outage)

## 4-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Detection & Classification (≤500 tokens)

**Inputs:**
- Incident signal (alert, report, manual trigger)
- Optional: service_context, compliance_requirements

**Actions:**
1. Parse incident signal and extract:
   - Incident description/symptoms
   - Affected service/system
   - Initial severity estimate
   - Timestamp (normalize to NOW_ET)

2. Classify incident type:
   - Security: data-breach, ransomware, unauthorized-access, malware
   - Infrastructure: outage, service-degradation, performance-issue
   - Disaster: data-center-failure, regional-outage, natural-disaster
   - Network: ddos, routing-failure, connectivity-loss

3. Assign severity (auto-escalation thresholds):
   - P0: Customer-facing impact, data breach, ransomware → Escalate to VP/C-level within 15min
   - P1: Partial degradation, contained security incident → Escalate to Director within 30min
   - P2: Internal systems impacted, no customer impact → Escalate to Manager within 2hr
   - P3: Minor issues, no service impact → Standard on-call escalation

4. Determine compliance requirements:
   - HIPAA: Health data breach → 60-day notification requirement
   - PCI-DSS: Payment data incident → Forensic investigation + QSA notification
   - SOC2: Any incident → CC7.3 communication documentation
   - FedRAMP: P0/P1 → Agency notification within 1 hour per IR-6(1)

**Outputs:**
- incident_classification: {type, severity, compliance_requirements}
- skill_routing_plan: [skill_slugs] based on incident type
- escalation_initiated: boolean (true if auto-escalation triggered)

---

### Step 2: Triage & Playbook Activation (≤2k tokens)

**Inputs:**
- incident_classification (from Step 1)
- service_context (optional, for T2 playbook generation)

**Actions:**
1. **Invoke resilience-incident-generator skill:**
   - Input: {incident_type, severity_level, compliance_requirements, tier: T1 or T2}
   - Output: playbook, escalation_matrix, post_mortem_template
   - For P0/P1: Use T2 tier (detailed playbook with service context)
   - For P2/P3: Use T1 tier (template playbook)

2. **Activate escalation matrix:**
   - Parse escalation_matrix from playbook
   - Notify stakeholders per severity thresholds:
     - P0: Incident Commander, CISO, VP Engineering (within 15min)
     - P1: Tech Lead, Security Lead, Director (within 30min)
     - P2: On-call engineer, Manager (within 2hr)
   - Create communication channels (Slack incident room, Zoom bridge, status page)

3. **Coordinate security assessment (if security incident):**
   - If incident_type in [data-breach, ransomware, unauthorized-access, malware]:
     - Invoke security-assessment-framework skill
     - Request: threat_model, attack_vector_analysis, IOC_extraction
     - Forensic preservation: logs, memory dumps, disk images, network traffic

4. **Coordinate monitoring/observability (if infrastructure incident):**
   - If incident_type in [outage, service-degradation, performance-issue]:
     - Query logs/metrics/traces for affected service
     - Generate debugging queries (Prometheus, Datadog, CloudWatch)
     - Validate health checks and dependency status

**Outputs:**
- activated_playbook: Full NIST SP 800-61 playbook (6 phases)
- escalation_status: {notified_stakeholders, channels_created}
- security_context: {threat_model, IOCs} (if security incident)
- observability_queries: [log_queries, metric_queries] (if infrastructure incident)

---

### Step 3: Response Execution & Timeline Tracking (≤2k tokens)

**Inputs:**
- activated_playbook (from Step 2)
- security_context or observability_queries (from Step 2)

**Actions:**
1. **Execute NIST SP 800-61 phases (guided by playbook):**
   - **Preparation:** Validate access to tools, credentials, contact lists
   - **Detection & Analysis:** Scope incident (affected systems, users, data)
   - **Containment:**
     - Short-term: Isolate affected systems, revoke credentials, block IPs
     - Long-term: Patch vulnerabilities, harden configurations
   - **Eradication:** Remove malware, close attack vectors, validate remediation
   - **Recovery:** Restore services, validate health checks, monitor for recurrence
   - **Post-Incident Activity:** Prepare for Step 4 (post-mortem)

2. **Track incident timeline:**
   - Record all actions with ISO-8601 timestamps (America/New_York)
   - Capture: timestamp, event, actor, action, outcome
   - Example: `{timestamp: "2025-10-26T02:15:00-04:00", event: "containment", actor: "security-team", action: "isolated database server", outcome: "success"}`

3. **Update stakeholders per communication plan:**
   - P0: Status updates every 30min (status page, Slack, email)
   - P1: Status updates hourly
   - P2: Status updates every 4hr or at phase transitions
   - External communications: Approved templates only (legal/PR review for P0)

4. **Validate success criteria (per playbook):**
   - Containment: No further spread of incident
   - Eradication: Root cause removed and verified
   - Recovery: Service restored, health checks passing, monitoring confirms stability

**Outputs:**
- incident_timeline: [{timestamp, event, actor, action, outcome}]
- phase_completion_status: {preparation: true, detection: true, containment: true, ...}
- stakeholder_updates: [update_log]
- remediation_artifacts: {patched_systems, revoked_credentials, config_changes}

### Step 4: Post-Mortem & Lessons Learned (≤1.5k tokens)

**Inputs:**
- incident_timeline (from Step 3)
- activated_playbook.post_mortem_template (from Step 2)
- security_context or observability_queries (from Step 2)

**Actions:**
1. **Generate post-mortem report:**
   - **Incident summary:** Type, severity, duration, customer impact
   - **Timeline:** Detailed event log (from incident_timeline)
   - **Root cause analysis:** Apply 5 Whys or Fishbone diagram
   - **Impact metrics:**
     - MTTD (Mean Time to Detect): Detection timestamp - Incident start
     - MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve): Resolution timestamp - Detection timestamp
     - Customer impact: % affected, duration, revenue impact estimate
     - Blast radius: Number of affected systems, users, data records

2. **Extract action items:**
   - Process improvements: Prevent recurrence (e.g., add monitoring, patch process)
   - Technical debt: Fix root cause (e.g., upgrade vulnerable library, harden config)
   - Compliance actions: HIPAA breach notification, PCI-DSS forensic report submission
   - Assign owners and due dates (within 30 days for P0/P1 actions)

3. **Generate compliance documentation (if applicable):**
   - **HIPAA breach:** 60-day breach notification template to HHS + affected individuals
   - **PCI-DSS incident:** Forensic investigation report + QSA notification
   - **SOC2 CC7.3:** Communication log documentation
   - **FedRAMP IR-6:** Incident report to Agency within 1 hour (P0)

4. **Archive incident artifacts:**
   - Playbook (generated in Step 2)
   - Incident timeline (tracked in Step 3)
   - Post-mortem report (generated in Step 4)
   - Forensic evidence (if security incident)
   - Communication logs and status updates

**Outputs:**
- post_mortem_report: {summary, timeline, root_cause, impact, action_items}
- compliance_reports: [{framework, report_type, submission_deadline, content}]
- action_items: [{owner, description, due_date, priority}]
- archived_artifacts: [file_paths or artifact_references]

## Decision Rules

**Incident type routing:**
- `security | data-breach | ransomware` → Invoke security-assessment-framework + resilience-incident-generator
- `outage | service-degradation` → Invoke observability-stack-generator + resilience-incident-generator
- `disaster-recovery` → Invoke resilience-incident-generator (T2 tier) + validate RTO/RPO
- `ddos` → Invoke security-assessment-framework (network threat analysis) + upstream provider coordination

**Playbook tier selection:**
- P0/P1 severity → Use T2 tier (detailed, service-specific playbook)
- P2/P3 severity → Use T1 tier (template playbook)
- service_context available → Use T2 tier
- service_context missing → Use T1 tier or request context

**Auto-escalation triggers:**
- **Duration:** P0 exceeds 30min, P1 exceeds 2hr, P2 exceeds 8hr → Escalate one level
- **Customer impact:** P0 any impact, P1 >10% affected, P2 >25% affected → Escalate
- **Disaster recovery:** Data center failure, regional outage, ransomware encryption → Invoke DR procedures

**Compliance invocation:**
- HIPAA + data-breach → Generate breach notification (60-day deadline)
- PCI-DSS + payment-data-incident → Coordinate forensic investigation + QSA notification
- SOC2 + any incident → Document communications per CC7.3
- FedRAMP + (P0 or P1) → Agency notification within 1 hour per IR-6(1)

**Abort conditions:**
- Incident type cannot be classified → Request human triage
- Required service_context missing for T2 playbook → Downgrade to T1 or request context
- Conflicting compliance requirements → Flag for legal/compliance review
