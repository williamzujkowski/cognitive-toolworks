## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- Initial release of Disaster Recovery Orchestrator agent
- 4-step workflow: Risk Assessment → DR Strategy → Implementation → Testing
- Integration with chaos-engineering-designer for DR validation
- Integration with incident-response-playbook-generator for runbook creation
- Integration with infrastructure-drift-detector for DR config monitoring
- Integration with sre-slo-calculator for RTO/RPO alignment
- NIST SP 800-34 Rev 1 compliance framework
- AWS/Azure/GCP disaster recovery pattern support
- RTO/RPO calculation and business impact analysis
- Multi-region failover architecture design
- Backup policy templates with 3-2-1 rule enforcement
- DR testing methodology (tabletop, partial, full, chaos)
- Cost estimation for DR strategies (backup/restore, pilot light, warm standby, multi-site)
- Example DR plan for payment processing platform
- Workflow templates for BIA questionnaire and RTO/RPO calculations

### Framework Support
- NIST SP 800-34 Rev 1 (Contingency Planning)
- AWS Disaster Recovery Patterns
- Azure Reliability Architecture
- Google Cloud DR Scenarios
- PCI-DSS disaster recovery requirements
- SOC2 business continuity controls

### Decision Rules
- RTO <1hr → warm standby or multi-site active-active
- RPO <5min → synchronous replication required
- Critical data → enforce 3-2-1 backup rule
- Zero DR test history → mandate quarterly drills
- Budget constraints → tiered strategy recommendations

### Quality Gates
- System prompt ≤1500 tokens
- Total AGENT.md ≤5000 tokens
- Examples ≤30 lines
- All timestamps use NOW_ET (NIST time.gov)
- No secrets or credentials in documentation
- All sources cited with access dates
