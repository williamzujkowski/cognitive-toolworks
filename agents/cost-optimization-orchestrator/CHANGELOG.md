## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- Initial release of Cost Optimization Orchestrator agent
- 4-step orchestration workflow: Discovery → Analysis → Recommendations → Implementation
- Integration with cost-optimization-analyzer skill for core analysis
- Multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- ROI-based prioritization for optimization recommendations
- Phased implementation planning with effort estimates
- Quick wins identification and runbook generation
- FinOps maturity assessment and progression guidance
- Executive summary generation for business stakeholders
- Continuous optimization process design
- Cost governance policy templates
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Support for T1 (quick wins) and T2 (comprehensive) analysis tiers

### Decision Rationale
- **Agent vs Skill**: Orchestrator coordinates multi-step workflows (discovery, analysis, recommendations, implementation) that exceed single-skill scope
- **Skill Integration**: Delegates core cost analysis to cost-optimization-analyzer skill following CLAUDE.md progressive disclosure principles
- **4-Step Pattern**: Aligns with FinOps Framework phases (Inform, Optimize, Operate) and enterprise change management
- **ROI Prioritization**: Business-focused approach ensures quick wins and strategic initiatives are balanced
- **Phased Rollout**: Reduces risk by separating quick wins (week 1) from production changes (weeks 2-4+)
